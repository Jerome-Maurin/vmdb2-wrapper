Following suggestion based  on vmdb2 original package 0.14.1-1.  

Tests was  done  on  amd64   Debian  Buster  10.3 with vmdb2   package
installed accross following line.

   sudo apt -t bullseye install vmdb2

REQ-0000: In order to use target  without any issue (!), please remove
root password  into /etc/shadow, so  that it is  possible  to login on
target without password at the first time. For  my point of vue, it is
user responsability to manage security platform (!)

REQ-0010: Add openssh-server Debian package,  so that when booting, it
is possible to  connect to target. It  is assumed here that  target is
connected to one mastered network (!)

  apt install -y openssh-server


REQ-0020: change security policy on /etc/ssh/sshd_config, so that root
Linux account can login on the target.  As a result, please launch :
    
  sed \
    -i \
    -e \
    's/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/g' \
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config

REQ-0030:  In order  to use  Ansible  later, please add python  Debian
package in the original target when creating debootstrap

   apt install -y python


REQ-0040:  Please create a command line  (or other mechanism) in order
to  manage packages list     when  creating deboostrap.    When  using
debootstrap,  is is possible  to  manage list of  mandatory package to
install  (option --include), and AT THE  TIME  the list of non whished
packages  (option --exclude).  With this   very usefull feature, it is
then  possible for example to use  sysvinit instead of systemd (and of
course all   dependancies  !).  In  my  user  case, please  note  that
following command works on armhf, amd64 and arm64 platforms.

     /usr/sbin/debootstrap \
       --verbose \
       --variant=buildd \
       --keep-debootstrap-dir \
       --include=apt-file,bind9-host,bridge-utils,curl,e2fsprogs,file,iputils-ping,isc-dhcp-client,ifupdown,iproute2,lsof,net-tools,openssh-client,openssh-server,openssh-sftp-server,psmisc,python-minimal,python-setuptools,sysvinit-core,sysvinit-utils,vim,vlan \
       --exclude=systemd,systemd-shim \
       buster|stretch|bullseye \
       /tmp/rootfs/  \
       http://deb.debian.org/debian

REQ-0050:  Is is  perhaps  a good idea  to  avoid to use sudo.  Just a
fakeroot ?
- Dont use root= in /etc/default/flash-kernel, contents of /etc/fstab in initramfs should suffice instead
- Add correct support for uuid in initramfs fsck, see logs
- Add ansible role juste befor emptying /etc/resolv.conf
- On Orange Pi R1, after ansible is added, add eth1 to network/interfaces
- All kernel in backports ?
- Could not use root= in /etc/default/flash-kernel, contents of /etc/fstab in initramfs should suffice, but root= seems good practice
- Generalize initramfs fsck hook ? fixed in cubietruck only for the moment, needs testing
- Add ssh and local user (add README explanations)
- Add ansible role juste before emptying /etc/resolv.conf
- On OrangePi R1, after ansible is added, add eth1 in dhcp to network/interfaces
- On NanoPi R1, after ansible is added, add eth1 in dhcp to network/interfaces
- Fix details of mount parameters to minimize writes to SD card (no journal, etc.)
- Add comments in yaml files
- Replace wget by proper apt install for armbian u-boots
- Add https support ? not yet, invalid cert domain for DE mirror
