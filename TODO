- Would be possible not to use root= in /etc/default/flash-kernel, contents of /etc/fstab in initramfs should suffice, but root= seems good practice
- Add ssh and local user (add README explanations)
- Add ansible role juste before emptying /etc/resolv.conf
- On OrangePi R1, after ansible is added, add eth1 in dhcp to network/interfaces
- On NanoPi R1, after ansible is added, add eth1 in dhcp to network/interfaces
- Fix details of mount parameters to minimize writes to SD card (no journal, etc.)
- Add comments in yaml files
- Replace wget by proper apt install for armbian u-boots ?
- Add https support ? not yet, invalid cert domain for DE mirror
