REQ-0000: In order to use target  without any issue (!), please remove
root password into  /etc/shadow , so  that it is  possible to login on
target without password

REQ-0010: Add openssh-server Debian package,  so that when booting, it
is possible to  connect to target. It  is assumed here that  target is
connected to one mastered network (!)

  apt install -y openssh-server


REQ-0020: change security policy on /etc/ssh/sshd_config, so that root
Linux account can login on the target.  As a result, please launch :
    
  sed \
    -i \
    -e \
    's/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/g' \
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config

REQ-0030:  In order  to use  Ansible  later, please add python  Debian
package in the original target when creating debootstrap

   apt install -y python


REQ-0040: Please create a  command line (or  other mechanism) in order
to  manage  packages list    when  creating deboostrap.    When  using
debootstrap, is is  possible to  manage  list of mandatory  package to
install (option  --include), and AT THE  TIME, manage the list  of non
whished packages (option --exclude).  Whith this very usefull feature,
it is then possible for  example to use sysvinit  instead of systemd (
and of course all dependancies !).  In my user  case, please note that
following command works on armhf and arm64 platforms.

     /usr/sbin/debootstrap \
       --verbose \
       --variant=buildd \
       --keep-debootstrap-dir \
       --include=apt-file,bind9-host,bridge-utils,curl,e2fsprogs,file,iputils-ping,isc-dhcp-client,ifupdown,iproute2,lsof,net-tools,openssh-client,openssh-server,openssh-sftp-server,psmisc,python-minimal,python-setuptools,sysvinit-core,sysvinit-utils,vim,vlan \
       --exclude=systemd,systemd-shim \
       buster|stretch|bullseye \
       /tmp/rootfs/  \
       http://deb.debian.org/debian  \
